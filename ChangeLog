AA added seconds() function to take timing of the force function. Took 26.583683 seconds with 108 atoms, almost 100% of the time taken by the whole program.
AA (almost) removed division in the loop, took 22.009221 seconds. Use of perf record suggests that pow is a bottleneck.
AA (almost) removed use of pow() in the loop, and redefined ffac, took 13.426059 seconds, almost 2x faster.
AA removed use of sqrt() in the loop, then removed completely the use of pow() with float exponent, took 3.395514 seconds, almost 8x faster than original version.
